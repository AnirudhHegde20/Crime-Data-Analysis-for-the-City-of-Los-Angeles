# Title:  Crime-Data-Analysis-for-the-City-of-Los-Angeles

### Description:
This project conducts a thorough analysis of Los Angeles crime data from 2020 to present, focusing on data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to understand crime trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of major events on crime rates. Employing Python and various libraries, we meticulously clean the dataset, explore correlations between crime rates and economic indicators, and analyze crime distributions across different times and regions.

### Objectives:
1. To clean and prepare the crime dataset for analysis.
2. To visualize and analyze crime trends over time and by region.
3. To investigate the impact of economic factors and major events on crime rates.
4. To predict future crime trends using time-series forecasting.

### Data Source:
The primary dataset was sourced from a government website, encompassing incident records of crimes within the City of Los Angeles dating back to 2020. The dataset underwent extensive cleaning to address issues such as missing data, duplicates, and outliers.

Data Source  : https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/

### Methodology:
1. Data Sourcing and Cleaning: Acquired from a government database, with extensive preprocessing to ensure accuracy and relevance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy) for data visualization and analysis.
3. Visualization and Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis covering overall crime trends, seasonal patterns, most common crime types, regional differences, and the correlation with economic factors.
4. Time-Series Forecasting: Employed SARIMAX and Prophet models to predict future crime trends.

### Key Findings:
1. Identified rising crime trends with the highest occurrences in 2022.
2. Revealed seasonal patterns, with summer months witnessing higher crime rates.
3. Demonstrated correlations between crime rates and economic indicators like unemployment and inflation.
4. Analyzed the impact of major events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, George Floyd protests) on crime rates.

### Limitations and Future Work:
Outlined the limitations encountered during the analysis and proposed directions for future research to enhance the understanding of crime trends and contribute to public safety strategies.

### Conclusion:
This project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of crime in Los Angeles, contributing to a deeper understanding of public safety challenges. The findings and methodologies outlined can serve as a foundation for further research and policy-making.
